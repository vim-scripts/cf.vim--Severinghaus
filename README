This is a reasonably complete syntax file for ColdFusion, up to at least version 7.0. I have pored over the LiveDocs fairly thoroughly to make sure that every valid tag, attribute, and function is included; nonetheless, if you find a problem, please let me know! The only current shortcoming that I'm aware of is that deprecated items are not highlighted properly, though they are tagged with the "Error" class.

Two screenshots are available, one of plain CFML and one of a ColdFusion component:
